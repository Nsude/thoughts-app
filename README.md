# About The Project
The thoughts web app is designed to be a thinking companion of some sort, leveraging ai to help users refine their thoughts in real-time, allowing them to create multiple versions of their thoughts, invite other users to brainstorm together, and view publicly available thoughts shared by other users.

### Tech Stack & Key components
1. NextJs: Although I'd never used NextJS until this project; reading through it's docs, I knew it was perfect for the application. The introduction of server side components, file based routing (which is not as complicated as complicated as it might sound), and built-in SEO capabilities sold me.

2. Convex: For my auth, backend and database needs, I opted to use convex; yet another technology I hadn't used before now (yeah save it, I know).

3. Slate (Rich text editor which I've also never used).

4. GSAP (for animations).

5. Resend as my email provider.

About [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org):

As opposed to other rich text editors, _slate_ provides a more flexible approach, they provide you with the tools you need to build whatever, it's then up to you what you do with them. This ofcourse is a gift and a curse as it has a bit of a learning curve, but it's relatively well documented and once you get a grasp of the concepts, it's incredibly easy to work with.
